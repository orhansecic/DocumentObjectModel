DOM - The Document Object Model
-------------------------------
- Mutating a content of a website without changing the HTML of a website.
- Basically, the work is done inside of the browser.

- DOM represents the HTML elements as JS objects, for an example, if we have a <h1></h1> element in
HTML then in DOM that element is represented as h1 object.
- Every webpage when it is loading in a browser, the browser takes the HTML and CSS files and goes
through them and creates for every element a JS object that represents it.
- These JS objects also hold attributes of HTML and CSS elements, for an example the "src" of an image
- This process is illustrated here: https://prnt.sc/wjnwa4
- Example with real HTML: https://prnt.sc/wjnwif

**************************************************************************
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Document Object+

- Document is an object that is automatically created out of HTML and CSS elements.
- It is the base object on which all HTML and CSS elements are represented as JS objects.
- Of course, like everything else generally, the document object also has its own methods and properties
that are created on the initialization.

- All HTML elements can be found in the "all" property of the "document" object.
- This "all" property is an array that holds HTML elements of the webpage, and user can access them
through their index in the array.
- Every HTML element is an object on its own and it has its own properties that we can then see and 
access and manipulate if we want to.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Selecting +

- Topic on how to select a specific HTML element / elements with JS

1. "getElementById()" method:
-----------------------------
- On the "document" object there exists a method that enables user to select a specific HTML element 
by his id.
- This method is called "getElementById()" and it accepts a string parameter that is equal to some id
attribute of some HTML element.
- What is returned with this method is not the HTML element, the method returns the JS object created
for that HTML element, basically the object that is part of the "document" object.

2. "getElementsByTagName()" method:
-----------------------------------
- Also a method attached to the document object.
- This method is used for finding all specific tags, meaning for an example if we want to get all "img"
tags, we just put the "img" string as a argument of the method and it will return all "img" tags of the
HTML file.
- "getElementsById()" method will return multiple tags, most likely, and it will return them in something
called the "HTML Collection".
- "HTML Collection" is similar to array, items are indexed with number and you access them and mutate
them with "[]" but it is not an array, its an array-like object.
- Example of selecting all "img" tags and getting a HTML Collection of them: https://prnt.sc/wjwj1w

3. "getElementsByClassName()" method:
-------------------------------------
- If we understand the logic in the 2 methods before this one is straight forward.
- We select and return all objects that represent HTML elements of specific class.
- It also returns the "HTML Collection" same as "getElementsByTagName()".

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Selecting with querySelector() and quesrySelectorAll()+

1. "querySelector()" method:
----------------------------
- querySelector() are used in the same way as getElement... methods
- it basically returns a element that we selected.
- the difference is that querySelector() is able to accept as argument all three values of three different
getElement... methods but it only returns a single HTML element, it can never return a collection.
- the element that is returned is the first element that satisfied the search.
- document.querySelector("p") - will return the first p element of HTML document

- important to note is that if we pass a class name or the id name as the argument we have to use 
the CSS symbols for classes and ids, ".classname" or "#idname"

2. "querySelectorAll()" method:
-------------------------------
- the same logic remains as it did with "querySelector()" just this method is able to return multiple
HTML elements as a "Node List".
- As far as I am able to understand is that "Node List" behaves the same way as "HTML Collection".

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Manipulate +

- Everything until now was to understand on how to select the specific element or group of elements 
through the document object.
- Impacting the webpage with JS.

1. "innerText" property
-----------------------
- "innerText" is a property of most HTML elements that holds the value of text that is between the 
opening and closing tags of HTML.
- changing the value of this property will change the content that that HTML element represents.
- For an example, document.querySelector("p").innerText = "KoKo", will make the paragraph tag have a
content of "KoKo".

2. "innerHTML" property
-----------------------
- it works the same way as "innerText" property just the biggest difference is that "innerHTML" can
accept and read the html tags that we add to the value of "innerHTML" while "innerText" just treats 
them like basic string.
- Example, document.querySelector("p").innerHTML = "<b>KoKo</b>" will return the "KoKo" string bolded
but if we used "innerText" it would return "<b>KoKo</b>" as the content of the paragraph.

- Important -
- we do not have to overwrite the value of property every time, we can also add to the property by using
the "+=" operator, typical for strings when we want to add something to the current value.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Attributes +

- attributes is a topic that is nothing new.
- attributes were constantly used when creating and using HTML tags and also CSS.
- attributes define some very important things, depending of the HTML tag of course, but in most cases
they are very important at defining the HTML tag itself.
- Easiest example is <img></img> tag has "src" attribute which defines the source of the image, basically
what will be rendered on the screen.

- As it was mentioned before, using any of the selecting methods it not only returns the object
representation of the HTML tag but it also returns the properties of that object, which are basically
different kinds of attributes that the HTML tag had.
- We select those attributes like anything else, using the "." dot operator.
- Changing the value of them changes the attribute, very straight forward.

+ There are two methods that are mostly used for setting and getting the attributes +

1. getAttribute()
2. setAttribute()
-----------------

1. getAttribute()
-----------------

- very simple and straight forward, it returns the value of the attribute that is passed as parameter.
- its important to note that this method is used on an element, of course we need to select a element
first then use this method and specify which attribute we want to return from this element.
- Example of returning a source of a image - https://prnt.sc/x5ky8s

2. setAttribute()
-----------------

- this method is used to set a specific attribute of a specific element.
- same as getAttribute() method we first have to select the element and then setAttribute on it.
- setAttribute() is a bit different because it accepts two parameters, first parameter specifies the
attribute name, and the second the attribute value.
- Example of setting the attribute of HTML tag -https://prnt.sc/x5l79x
- Of course this can also be done on undefined attributes.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Changing Style +

- changing style of an HTML tag is done with CSS, that is the recommended way of doing.
- style can be manipulated in many different ways, meaning that location of CSS code can be found in
different locations.
- the most common one and also the one that is recommended for use is: creating a separate CSS file
that we link to the HTML file that we want to style.
- second one is using the inline style, style inside the HTML opening tags of HTML elements ( using
the "style" attribute ) 
- and the third option is using the <style></style> HTML tag

- Every HTML element inside of the DOM has "style" property added to it.
- This style property is an object that holds the properties of all possible styles of that HTML element
- We just select any property of "style" object and mutate it how we want it, and the style will change
- The problem is that "style" object, I mean his properties, only show values of inline styles, for
an example, using the first method of adding CSS - we set the colour of h1 element to "red" and it does
render with "red" colour but inside of "style" object attached to h1 HTML element the property colour
of "style" object does not have a value.
- It does have a value but it is not shown there, unfortunately, it only shows the inline styles.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ classList +

- classes are a great way of adding multiple lines of style to multiple HTML tags at once.
- with DOM we are able to add class attributes to HTML elements.
- setAttribute() and getAttribute() methods are the most basic way of setting the class attribute of 
a HTML element and also getting the information what is the value of class attribute of elements.
- but these two methods are not the most effective and efficient way of getting and setting that
information, first of all it takes a long time to set it and also we are unable to set multiple names
of classes easily - because in some cases we want the class attribute to have multiple values.

- That is where "classList" object comes into play.
- "classList" object is located on every HTML element and it has its own properties that enable us to
do multiple different actions with classes.
- "classList" holds the value of all classes of that specific HTML element, and its formed to a 
array like list.
- Example: -https://prnt.sc/xfyjre

- Properties of "classList" can be seen here: -https://prnt.sc/xfymhw
- The most basic ones and the most common ones are: 
1. add - accepts the parameter of class name that will be added to the HTML element
2. contains - returns the boolean value if the HTML element contains the class name
3. remove - removes the class name that we passed as parameter to the method
4. replace - accepts two parameter, the first one is the class name that we want to replace the second is the value that replaces it
5. toggle - toggles the impact of class on the specific HTML element
6. length - returns the length of the classList 
-These of course are not the only ones.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Hierarchical Chain +

- Everything we program in any programming language has a hierarchical chain that it follows.
- In this case we are talking about the child and parent relationship between the HTML tags that we 
create.
- For an example, everything is a child of "<html>" tag, everything shown on screen is the child of
"<body>" tag, while "<span>" is a child of "<p>" tag ( for an example ).
- Now, DOM enables us to follow this chain of hierarchy and go upwards for an example.

1. "parentElement"
------------------
- Every HTML element, has a "parentElement" property that returns the HTML element that is a parent 
to that element.
- Example of "parentElement": https://prnt.sc/xhzxuh

2. "children"
-------------
- "children" property returns an array-like element that holds all children of the HTML element.
- HTML elements only have one direct parent but can have multiple children.
- We of course move through this array-like element with indexes.

3. "previousElementSibling" and "nextElementSibling"
---------------------------------------------------
- it selects the next or previous sibling of the HTML element we are currently on.
- siblings are just HTML elements in the same level of the hierarchical chain.
- for an example, <p> has multiple <span> elements inside of it, paragraph is the parent to spans
while spans are siblings to one another.

- its very important to notice the "Element" part of the property because it will return the HTML
element rendered on the webpage.
- There is also the "previousSibling" and "nextSibling" without the "Element" but it can sometimes act
a bit strange on the first glance, because it look at the webpage in the browser and returns the gaps
between the images (for an example), basically anything that is shown on the page.
- while "Element" focuses more on the things that we created with our HTML tags.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Creating Elements (append and appendChild) +

- DOM can also be used to directly create elements and show (append) them on the webpage.

1. "createElement()"
--------------------

- createElement() is a method on the document object that accepts a parameter which is a HTML tag.
- It will create a HTML element from that parameter, but it will not be shown on the webpage.
- Of course, if we are creating an image or an anchor element we need to mutate some of its attributes,
such as "src" or "href"

- creating element with this method is just creating an element that is not shown on the webpage, it 
is attached to the document but it does not have any parent nor child properties.
- meaning it is not part of the hierarchical chain.
- we add these elements to the hierarchical chain by using append and appendChild methods.

2. "appendChild()"
------------------

- first we select the HTML element that we want to attach a child HTML element to.
- then we use this method and pass it an argument, argument is the newly element that will become a child
of the selected element.
- for an example, we created an element with "createElement()" method and we want to show this element
on a webpage, it means that it has to become a part of the hierarchical chain, we add it to the hierarchical
chain by creating a parent/child relationship between this newly created element and element on the 
webpage. 

- Important to note is that "appendChild()" adds the element as the last child of the parent element,
meaning it will be rendered last.

- Example: https://prnt.sc/xlmwy4

- IMPORTANT - appendChild() method only accepts objects as parameters, meaning only accepts HTML elements
nothing else, not even a variable with a string or number value inside of it.

3. "append()"
-------------

-"append()" is very similar to the "appendChild()" just it is able to accept strings as arguments and
also it is able to accept multiple arguments that will attach as last children to the parent element.

4. "prepend()"
--------------
- same as "append()" just it sets the element as the first child of that parent element.

++ Honourable Mentions to Research ++
1. insertAdjacentElement()
2. after()
3. before()

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Removing Elements (remove() and removeChild()) +

1. "removeChild()"
------------------

- method used for removing children of selected element.
- the child is passed as an argument to the method.

2. "remove()"
-------------

- remove() method that is used on the element that we want to remove.
- it does not accept any parameters, it just removes the element that it invoked the method.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Events +

- key for creating interactive websites
- creating a response to what user is doing.
- click, double-click, copy, paste, drag, drop, scroll, hover, keyboard clicks...

1. Inline Events 
----------------

- inline events is the first method of implementing event handlers.
- it is not the best way of implementing events and event handlers into the HTML and CSS.
- it is basically the same thing as implementing inline style.
- which is adding the "js" code in the opening tags of HTML element.

- This is not the best way of implementing events, because first of all the code looks messy, its 
very hard to find mistakes, because the lines of code are very long.

2. Function Expressions
-----------------------

- second method is also not the best method for implementing events and event handlers, but it is more
common then the inline events.
- It uses separate "js" file, which is great, but it fully implements the event handler inside of it.
- by selecting the HTML element on which we want to have the event handler and then selecting the 
event handler (all event handlers are just properties of HTML elements) and setting the value of event
handler to some function.
- Example: https://prnt.sc/xq2dph

3. "addEventListener()"
-----------------------

- "addEventListener()" is a method that adds the event listener to any element that was selected.
- we select the HTML element first and then call the method "addEventListener()" that all HTML elements
have.
- "addEventListener()" accepts two parameters, first is the "string" name of the event ( onclick is "click")
while the second parameter is the already defined function that we just call without invoking it 
(without the "()") or we define the function on the fly.
-Example with a h1 HTML element and click event with twist function - https://prnt.sc/xrtvvr

- with "addEventListener()" method we can add multiple functions to the event listener, just repeating
the call for the "addEventListener()" and changing the parameters, parameters will just stack in the 
HTML element.

- addEventListener() method has some interesting parameters that we can pass to it, if interested it
can be found on the MDN.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Events and The Keyword "This" +

- As we already know before the keyword "This" can be a bit tricky, because it changes its value
depending of where it is located. In what execution context it is.
- In DOM, specifically when we are talking about events, this keyword is used to point to the HTML 
element that has the event listener on it.

- Example: https://prnt.sc/xx5myb

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Event Object and preventDefault()+

- Event object is a object that is created by default and passed to the callback function of
addEventListener() method.
- This event has to be named by developer, meaning that we need to define it in the argument/parameter
brackets of the function, so we have a name that we can point to.
- This event object holds all important information about the event that happened, for an example the
click or double click that user made. Furthermore, it holds also some information about the whole event
from the click to the response.

- Example: https://prnt.sc/xxe1pe
- in the example I defined this Event Object as "e" and just print it out in the console, we can see
that it has many different properties that hold the information about the event that has happened on
this HTML element and that Event Listener responded to.

- As it was mentioned before, the Event Object's scope of properties and information that he holds
does not stop just at the event that some user did. Meaning it does not have only information about
the click itself, but it also has some information about the eventHandler and also the response to 
the event itself.
- One of the methods on the Event Object is the "preventDefault()" method that prevents the default
behaviour of the eventHandler that we added to the "button" for an example ( default behaviour of a 
button would be click event if we added the click event to it )

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Keyboard Events +

- Keyboard Events are events that are happening on the keyboard and the event handler is listening
for them and of course responding to them.
- Keyboard is a bit specific way of inputting, it is divided into "key"s ( dugme na tastaturi ) and
every "key" has a "keycode" (keycode is the location of that specific key on the keyboard - "left alt")
- Furthermore, through the event listeners we can see that the key presses are divided into pressing
down and releasing the key.

1. "keydown" - event listener that is looking for event of pressing a keyboard key in the HTML element on 
which the event listener is.
2. "keyup" - keydown is when the button is pressed, keyboard button going down, while the keyup is
when the keyboard button is going up.
- Very straight forward and easy to understand.
- Very important to note is that these two event listeners will record any kind of button press on
the HTML element that it is attached to, it does not matter if its something visible as a letter in
the "input" tag or a ctrl press. All of them will be recorded as a event.

- These new events are used in the example of explaining the Event Object further.
- For a "keydown" and "keyup" the event object has properties that record what key was pressed.
- "key" and "code" are those properties that tell you what key was pressed.
- Example: https://prnt.sc/xxf7v8

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Form Events +

- <form> </form> is a HTML tag that is used for creating a section on your webpage that is used for
collecting data from the user.
- inside of the "form" HTML tag there are different HTML tags that we can use, the most common ones 
are <input></input> that is used for creating a input field for user to input some information, and
almost always next to the "input" tag is the <label></label> that is basically just a simple "span"
but it is used in the "form" HTML tag.

- Same as every other HTML element in the DOM and JS, "form" has its own event handlers that respond
to the specific events that are happening to him.
- These event handlers are of course inside the attributes of this HTML element.

- Event that was used in the Video tutorial was the "submit" event that submits the data of the form
to the specific endpoint (this endpoint is specified in the action attribute of the "form")
- In this video the event's method preventDefault() was used to prevent this transfer of data to the
endpoint.

- Every form HTML element has a specific property inside of it called "elements" that shows the 
HTML collection of all elements that a form has. 
- Basically, it shows the children inside of the form HTML element.
- Important to note is that all children of the form are shown twice, if we used the "name" attribute
of all elements inside the form. That is why we are able to call them by their names and not by their
indexes.

- Example of selecting the "username" input HTML element inside of the form called "tweetForm" - https://prnt.sc/y06dz2
- When we select the element, in this case the input HTML element, we of course then can access his
attributes, the attributes that the input HTML element normally has ( like "value" attribute).
