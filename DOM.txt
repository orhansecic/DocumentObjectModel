DOM - The Document Object Model
-------------------------------
- Mutating a content of a website without changing the HTML of a website.
- Basically, the work is done inside of the browser.

- DOM represents the HTML elements as JS objects, for an example, if we have a <h1></h1> element in
HTML then in DOM that element is represented as h1 object.
- Every webpage when it is loading in a browser, the browser takes the HTML and CSS files and goes
through them and creates for every element a JS object that represents it.
- These JS objects also hold attributes of HTML and CSS elements, for an example the "src" of an image
- This process is illustrated here: https://prnt.sc/wjnwa4
- Example with real HTML: https://prnt.sc/wjnwif

- Document is an object that is automatically created out of HTML and CSS elements.
- It is the base object on which all HTML and CSS elements are represented as JS objects.
- Of course, like everything else generally, the document object also has its own methods and properties
that are created on the initialization.
